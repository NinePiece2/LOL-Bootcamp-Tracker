# UI/UX Improvements

## Overview
This document outlines the major UI/UX improvements made to the LoL Bootcamp Tracker dashboard.

## üéØ Key Features Implemented

### 1. **Modal Lobby Details**
- **Problem**: Clicking "Show Lobby" expanded content inline, causing page layout shifts and poor UX
- **Solution**: Implemented a reusable Modal component that displays lobby details in a popup overlay
- **Benefits**:
  - No page size changes or layout shifts
  - Better focus on lobby information
  - Cleaner, more professional appearance
  - Keyboard support (ESC to close)
  - Click outside to dismiss

### 2. **Selectable Stream Tiles**
- **Feature**: Users can now select which streams to display
- **How it works**:
  - Hover over any stream to reveal the selection toggle (eye icon)
  - Click the eye icon to select/deselect streams
  - Selected streams show with a purple highlight and filled eye icon
  - Deselected streams show with a gray outline and crossed-out eye icon
  - Maximum of 4 streams can be selected at once
- **Benefits**:
  - Personalized viewing experience
  - Focus on preferred streamers
  - Visual feedback for selection state

### 3. **Drag-and-Drop Stream Ordering**
- **Feature**: Selected streams can be reordered via drag-and-drop
- **How it works**:
  - When streams are selected, a drag handle (grip icon) appears on hover
  - Click and drag streams to reorder them
  - Visual feedback during drag (opacity and scale changes)
  - The stream grid updates in real-time
- **Benefits**:
  - Customize stream layout
  - Put favorite streamers in preferred positions
  - Intuitive interaction pattern

### 4. **Stream Control Toolbar**
- **Feature**: A dedicated toolbar appears when streams are selected
- **Elements**:
  - Grip icon indicating drag-and-drop capability
  - Counter showing number of selected streams
  - "Drag to reorder" instruction text
  - "Clear" button to deselect all streams
- **Benefits**:
  - Clear visual indication of selection mode
  - Easy way to reset selection
  - Helpful user guidance

### 5. **Enhanced Visual Feedback**
- **Hover States**: 
  - Stream tiles show selection controls on hover
  - Drag handle appears when in selection mode
  - Purple ring appears on hover
- **Selection States**:
  - Purple background and ring for selected streams
  - Gray background for deselected streams
  - Smooth transitions between states
- **Drag States**:
  - Opacity reduction and scale effect during drag
  - Cursor changes to move/grab when draggable

## üõ†Ô∏è Technical Implementation

### New Components

#### Modal Component (`src/components/ui/modal.tsx`)
```typescript
- Reusable modal overlay component
- Backdrop click to close
- ESC key to close
- Customizable max width (sm, md, lg, xl, 2xl, 4xl, 6xl)
- Smooth animations
- Body scroll lock when open
```

### Updated Components

#### Main Page (`src/app/page.tsx`)
- Added lobby modal state management
- Implemented drag-and-drop handlers
- Added stream selection logic
- Enhanced stream grid with interactive controls

#### LiveGamesSection (`src/app/LiveGamesSection.tsx`)
- Added modal support with `onLobbyClick` prop
- Added `expandedByDefault` prop for modal usage
- Made `expandedLobby` and `onToggleLobby` optional
- Intelligent handling of different display modes

## üé® User Experience Flow

### Stream Selection Flow:
1. User hovers over a stream tile
2. Eye icon appears in top-right corner
3. Click to select/deselect stream
4. Toolbar appears showing selection count
5. User can drag streams to reorder
6. "Clear" button resets all selections

### Lobby Details Flow:
1. User sees "Show Lobby" button on live game card
2. Click opens modal overlay
3. Lobby details display without affecting page layout
4. User can close via X button, ESC key, or clicking outside
5. Page state preserved when modal closes

## üì± Responsive Considerations

- Modal is responsive with max-height constraints
- Stream grid adapts to different screen sizes
- Touch-friendly targets for mobile devices
- Smooth transitions work across devices

## üöÄ Future Enhancement Ideas

1. **Persist Selection**: Save stream selection to localStorage
2. **Custom Layouts**: Let users create custom grid layouts (1x1, 2x2, 3x1, etc.)
3. **Stream Presets**: Save favorite stream combinations
4. **Picture-in-Picture**: Allow streams to float outside the grid
5. **Synchronized Audio**: Control audio from multiple streams
6. **Stream Quality**: Add quality selection per stream
7. **Chat Integration**: Embed Twitch chat alongside streams

## üêõ Known Limitations

- Maximum 4 streams can be selected (design constraint)
- Drag-and-drop works best on desktop (touch support is basic)
- Stream embeds may take time to load depending on Twitch API

## üìù Code Quality

- TypeScript type safety throughout
- Proper error handling
- Clean separation of concerns
- Reusable components
- Accessible markup
- Performance optimized with React best practices
